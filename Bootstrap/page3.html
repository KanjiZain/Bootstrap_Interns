            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
        </p>

        <p>
            The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and
            in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, 
            avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
        </p>

        <span class=" h2" id="head_text">How it spreads</span>
            <p>

                Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through
                contact with an infected person when they
                cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person
                touches a surface or object that has the virus
                on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
